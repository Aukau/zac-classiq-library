# âœ… Solutions â€“ Quantum GAN Challenge

This folder contains reference solutions for the [qGAN Challenge Notebook](../qGAN_challenge.ipynb), which guides users through building a hybrid quantum-classical GAN to model QFT states.

## ðŸ“„ Files

- `qGAN_challenge_solved.ipynb`  
  The fully completed notebook with all implementation sections filled in. Use this to compare your work or guide your learning.

- Additional `.py` or `.ipynb` files (if applicable)  
  Any modular code used to support the solved notebook, such as enhanced training loops or circuit visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Intended Use

These solutions are intended for:

- Learners who have attempted the challenge and want to cross-check their answers
- Instructors looking to validate or adapt the notebook for teaching
- Researchers or developers seeking a reference implementation

Please try completing the challenge on your own first before referring to these solutions â€” that's where the real learning happens!
