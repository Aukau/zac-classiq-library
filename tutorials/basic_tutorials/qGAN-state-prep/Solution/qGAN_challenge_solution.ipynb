    "# Quantum Generative Adversarial Network for QFT State Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this challenge notebook! In this lab you will build the **ansatz circuit** for a **Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (qGAN)** to prepare quantum Fourier transform (QFT) states. The exercise is inspired by recent work on variational quantum algorithms and, in particular, the use of qGANs to learn probability distributions using a hybrid classical–quantum approach. If you are new to qGANs, take a moment to review the structure of a generator–discriminator pair, either from your course notes or by consulting the paper by [Cerezo et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09265). This notebook breaks the problem down into a sequence of tasks so that you can implement the core components yourself."

    "Before diving into the implementation, you should have a basic understanding of how a qGAN is constructed. The generator is a quantum circuit that produces a parametrized quantum state, while the discriminator is a classical neural network trained to distinguish samples from the generator versus real data. A variational ansatz for the generator must be expressive enough to represent the target distribution but simple enough to train.\n",
